# Welcome!


## Introduction

This exercise will mimic a routine day in the life of a data scientist. It will cover the tasks such as data extraction, dataset creation, cleaning, processing followed by exploratory data analysis which will lead to building of some statistical models which are specific to the problem solving in the domain of a data driven venture capital.


## Loading the dataset

The dataset is available for the purpose of this exercise is in the format of a JSON file. Most of the data which is stored in the backend is in the format of JSON. The objective for a data scientist to accomplish the business purposes through analytics is to obtain the data in the tabular format. Now, the first steps towards making sense of the data is to start reading it. In the directory that you've cloned, read the file `founders.json` into a variable called `founders`.


Now, your objective is to inspect the structure of the JSON file. Once you've made some observations about the JSON file, you may write your observations about the JSON file in not more than 200-300 words. Feel free to go as indepth as you like. Remember, that it is a learning exercise and you're free to express the best out of your observation skills.

Now, once you've read and understood the structure of the JSON file, now we will attempt to convert the file that we have read into a tabular strcutured dataframe for the purposes of anlytics. In order to do that, load the relevant libraries and convert the JSON file that you've read as the `founders`variable into a pandas dataframe with the same name `founders` in such a way that each row corresponds to one organisation. Now, examine the dataframe and clean it for any missing values and write you actions in about 50-100 words. Print the result.
